description
"Example used in Thomas Paris' thesis to exemplify hierarchical multi-model design.
This multimodel represents one corridor linked to 10 offices, it is the last step of the thermal example.
This multimodel is designed in a hierarchical way (room, heated room, floor).
It contains 11 submodels Room, each Room is composed of one FMU and on Java ad-hoc air conditioner controller.
The outside temperature comes from an SQL database, these data were collected by APHEEN.
Each connection between rooms, and between room and outdoor temperature is represented by wall models (FMU).
Finally there are 41 FMU (11 for rooms, 30 for walls), 11 Java ad-hoc models and one SQL source model."
