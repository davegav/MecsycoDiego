	information
		description "Experiment on hybrid highway, this experiment comes from Benjamin Camus' thesis. We use the same parameters.
This experiment contains three models and four kind of heterogeneities : simulation tools, formalisms, time and data representation.
In terms of : 
-simulation tools, the micro model is built in NetLogo whereas the other models are Java ad-hoc;
-formalisms, micro model is a multi-agent model, the cell model is equationnal and the event model is a discrete event model;
-time representation, cell and event models time is in hour, the one of micro model is nearly 0.1 second (0.00004h).
-data representation, micro model and event model represents atomic cars whereas cell models only represents streams.
