description "Multimodel used to show illustrate the NetLogo model artifact and the ability to move agents from one model to another.
There is three NetLogo models, the first one is a standard NetLogo wolf-sheep predation model. 
Each sheep which arrives at the right side of the world is captured and sent to the second model.
The second model is a NetLogo pedestrian model, it represents the previous sheep transport to the third model.
This last model, called heaven model, is a NetLogo wolf-sheep predation models without wolves."
