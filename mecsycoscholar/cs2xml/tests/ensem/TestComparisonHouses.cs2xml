	information description "Model representing two houses submitted to outdoor temperature. 
The first house is passive while the second one contains an air conditioner which tries to maintain the temperature.
A weather database is used to get the outdoor temperature, the data were collected by APHEEN.
This multimodel is used during a student practice at ENSEM for the co-simulation course, it enables to exemplify co-simulation and heterogeneity handling.
Models : 
-1 SQL database as source model for the weather.
-2 FMU for Houses, exported from OpenModelica and built using the BuildSysPro library from EDF R&amp;D.
-1 Java ad-hoc model for the controller (note that a Matlab version of this controller exists).

 		commStep=1  // Number of time steps between each communication time, keep 1.
